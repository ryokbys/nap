The scheduler used in Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX100.
Since it seems to be no specific name for the scheduler, actually the scheduler
is a part of the "Technical Computing Suite (TCS)", this module was named as fujitsu.py.
The schedulers used in FX10 and K computer are supposed to be the same as this,
but it has not been tested for those two systems.
