               cell-based algorithm, its extension to parallel computers as
               well as two variants of the communication scheme are discussed.
               We provide performance numbers for simulations of different
               sizes and compare them with values found in the literature.
               Finally we describe two applications, namely a very large scale
               simulation with more than 1.23?109 atoms, to our knowledge the
               largest published MD simulation up to this day and a simulation
               of a crack propagating in a two-dimensional quasicrystal.",

               The proposed method employs the cuckoo search algorithm with an
               automatic update of search space to optimize parameters in
               empirical potentials to reproduce radial and angular
               distribution functions and equilibrium volume obtained from the

               LiZr2(PO4)3 and LaF3 systems parameterized using the present
               method well reproduce key physical properties required to study
               ion conductivity of solid-state electrolyte materials. The
               current approach takes only one or two days to produce a

               is placed on the features added since the initial release:
               interactions represented by analytical functions, differential
               evolution as optimization method, and a greatly extended set of
               interaction models. Beyond the initially present pair and
               embedded-atom method potentials, potfit can now also optimize
               angular dependent potentials, charge and dipolar interactions,
               and electron-temperature-dependent potentials. We demonstrate
               the functionality of these interaction models using three

               resulting deep potential-ZBL model can not only provide overall
               good performance on the predictions of near-equilibrium material
               properties but also capture the right physics when atoms are
               extremely close to each other, an event that frequently happens
               in computational simulations of irradiation damage events. We
               applied this scheme to the simulation of the irradiation damage
               processes in the face-centered-cubic aluminum system and found
               better descriptions in terms of the defect formation energy,
