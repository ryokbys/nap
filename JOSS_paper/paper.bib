               sizes and compare them with values found in the literature.
               Finally we describe two applications, namely a very large scale
               simulation with more than 1.23?109 atoms, to our knowledge the
               largest published MD simulation up to this day and a simulation

               We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using
