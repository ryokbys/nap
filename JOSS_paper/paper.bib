               The proposed method employs the cuckoo search algorithm with an
               automatic update of search space to optimize parameters in
               empirical potentials to reproduce radial and angular
               distribution functions and equilibrium volume obtained from the

               alloys, which include a few percent of Mg and Si, are important
               in automotive and aviation industries because of their low
               weight, as compared to steels, and the fact their strength can
               be greatly improved through engineered precipitation. To enable
               atomistic-level simulations of both the processing and
               performance of this important alloy system, a neural network
               (NN) potential for the ternary Al-Mg-Si has been created.
               Training of the NN uses an extensive database of properties
               computed using first-principles density functional theory,
               including complex precipitate phases in this alloy. The NN
               potential accurately reproduces most of the pure Al properties
               relevant to the mechanical behavior as well as heat of solution,
               solute-solute, and solute-vacancy interaction energies, and
               formation energies of small solute clusters and precipitates
               that are required for modeling the early stage of precipitation
               and mechanical strengthening. This success not only enables
